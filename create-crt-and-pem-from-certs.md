    ### Creating `.crt` and `.pem `files from domain certificates for a domain
    
    #### 🔐 Files Required
    
    You should have the following certificate files:
    
    - **Private Key:** `example_com.key`
    - **Primary Certificate (Issued to your domain):** `STAR_example_com.crt`
    - **Intermediate Certificate:** `SectigoRSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt`
    - **Root Certificate:** `USERTrustRSACertificationAuthorityCARoot.crt`
    
    ---
    
    #### 📌 Create `.crt` File (Full Chain without Private Key)
    
    Use the following command to combine your domain certificate with the intermediate and root certificates:
    
    ```bash
    cat STAR_example_com.crt \
        SectigoRSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt \
        USERTrustRSACertificationAuthorityCARoot.crt > example_com.crt
    ```
    
    This `.crt` file is typically used in Apache or Nginx, along with your private key.

    #### 📌 Create `.pem` File (Private Key + Full Chain)
    
    Use this command to create a `.pem` file that includes your private key and the entire certificate chain:
    
    ```bash
    cat example_com.key \
        STAR_example_com.crt \
        SectigoRSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt \
        USERTrustRSACertificationAuthorityCARoot.crt > example_com.pem
    ```
    
    This file is ideal for services that require a single bundle containing both the key and certificates like 'HaProxy'

    #### 🧪 Verify the Certificate Using OpenSSL

To check that the certificate chain is correctly formed:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443
```
